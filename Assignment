fig = px.box(employee_data, x = "JobRole", y = "DistanceFromHome", color = "Attrition")

From the boxplots above, distance from home is likely to be a factor leading to employee attrition for some roles but generally to a small extent

fig = px.box(employee_data, x = "Education", y = "MonthlyIncome", color = "Attrition")
fig.show()

From the boxplots, there is a general trend where people with lower salaries than others with the same education level are likely to quit their jobs

fig = px.box(employee_data, x = "YearsAtCompany", color = "Attrition")
fig.show()

Generally, employees who have been in the company for a long time are more likely to be retained in the company

fig = px.box(employee_data, x = "YearsSinceLastPromotion", color = "Attrition")
fig.show()

Job promotion is likely to improve employee retention in the company.

fig = px.box(employee_data, x = "Age", color = "Attrition")
fig.show()

Based on the boxplots above, the average age of people who quit their jobs is lower than those who are retained in the company

In summary, the following factors are observed to be major potential contributors to employee retention:

+ Monthly Income
+ Years Since Last Promotion
+ Age
+ Years At Company
+ Distance From Home
